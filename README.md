# Hakathon-Project
My project is an Online Calculator with Voice Recognition which allows the users to perform basic arithmetic operations using voice commands or the on-screen keyboard. It's web-based and can be accessed from any browser. The calculator is open-source and licensed under MIT. Contributions are welcome.
